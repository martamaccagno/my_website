title: About me

Smiling and motivated: these are probably the best two words used to describe me. I am a very happy and positive person, really close to my family and particularly to my brother: we live together in Milan, we help each other a lot and we have a great relationship. I will miss him these months, but I know he will miss me more because nobody will cook and do the laundry for him.
