I am really close to my family and particularly to my brother: we spent three years living together in Milan, we always help each other and we have a great relationship. I am missing him these months, but I know he is missing me more because nobody is cooking, going to supermarket and doing the laundry for him! 

I consider myself extremely lucky as my family has always supported me. My parents have always been my main point of reference, especially when it comes to education. Since an early age they pushed me to always keep learning and to challenge myself beyond my comfort zone; they exposed me to different cultures because they believed that an open mind is a prerequisite for success, be it personal or professional. In particular, my father, who is my biggest role model, encouraged me to study abroad, explaining that it would develop my global mind-set. 

After my brother and I went to University, we didn't have the opportunity to spend a lot of time all together as my brother was working, I was studying and we both were living in Milan. However, we spent almost three months together during the lockdown and my parents were very happy to have us at home again. Every Saturday at dinner my father told us that it was the best thing that happened to him during the lockdown - being all together again!
