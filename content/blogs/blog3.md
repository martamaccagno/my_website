*Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn’t do than by the ones you did. So throw off the bowlines, Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails.  Explore. Dream. Discover* Mark Twain


From my point of view, there is nothing like traveling, seeing a new place for the first time or returning to a favorite one. Traveling is a big deal. Going out and exploring the unknown is a life-changing experience. You get to try new things, discover new places, connect with different people and, most importantly, you can have a deeper understanding of you are as a couple. There will be certain situations which can push you to the limit. It’s soothing to know that you can hold somebody’s hand when you need it.

YOU GAIN KNOWLEDGE
One of the most generous compensations of traveling is that you get to know and understand so many new things. You’ll get to know places and people that maybe you have disregarded before. The world is monumental, and we are just a small part of it. This is the first lesson you learn when you make traveling a habit. Getting this fresh perspective will then change your entire vision on what is really important. You will learn to truly value simple things like drinking bottled water or having an Internet connection.


The idea is to breathe knowledge and be open minded. It is the only way traveling can get you wiser. It is the only way you can get to tell your grandchildren really amazing stories.
