title: About me
---

Smiling, motivated and determined: these are probably the best three words used to describe me. 
I am a very happy and positive person, always willing to help and I love spending time with other people. 
I am currently enrolled in the MSc in Financial Analysis at London Business School and I completed a BSc at Bocconi University with a grade of 110 cum Laude. I believe this shows how determination and passion are the characteristics that lead me where I stand today. 

If there is one thing I learned throughout all my experiences is that the more challenging something is, the more you can learn from it. In the last years I have accurately followed this idea, being fully committed to my professional growth and I do not intend to stop now. Instead, I have a strong desire to challenge myself further and the MFA would be the best way to do it, at this stage of my life. Indeed, this opportunity would allow me to achieve objectives that only a few people have the chance to reach, representing therefore a value added on the job market. In addition, living abroad, meeting new people and adapting to a different culture are all extremely ambitious goals, which would challenge me on a daily basis and consequently make me grow.

In my spare time I love skiing and, since I come from a very small village in the North of Italy close to the mountains, in winter I usually have the chance to go skiing a lot with my friends and my family. 
This year it would probably be different, as I am in London and because of Covid-19, but I am in love with the city, I live with my friends and there are a lot of things you can do. I am optimistic the situation will improve in the next months. Fingers crossed!
