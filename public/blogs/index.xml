      <description>Smiling, motivated and determined: these are probably the best three words used to describe me. I am a very happy and positive person, always willing to help and I love spending time with other people. I am currently enrolled in the MSc in Financial Analysis at London Business School and I completed a BSc at Bocconi University with a grade of 110 cum Laude. I believe this shows how determination and passion are the characteristics that lead me where I stand today.</description>

      <description>I am really close to my family and particularly to my brother: we spent three years living together in Milan, we always help each other and we have a great relationship. I am missing him these months, but I know he is missing me more because nobody is cooking, going to supermarket and doing the laundry for him! I look forward to the end of October when they will come to London and I will take them around.</description>
